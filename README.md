# MHC_GRW_genome_2022

This is a collection of scripts used in "The genomic architecture 
of the Major Histocompatibility Complex of passerines reveals MHC 
genes with contrasting evolutionary histories: old single copy 
genes and young tandemly duplicated genes"


## Script and code description

The code that was run to analyse the MHC regions of the great 
reed warbler genome along with the chicken, Hooded crow, jackdaw and 
zebra finch genomes is described in `workflows/`. Accompanying scripts 
are available in `scripts/`.
